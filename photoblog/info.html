    <p>Bulgaria was the last place I traveled to. I lived there for about 2 years and experienced a lot of new things. I lived in Sofia but traveled to other parts like Plovdiv and Burgas. Bulgaria has culture and traditions differ from those of any other place I have experienced. It took me some getting used to but I began to love it by the time I had to leave <a href="bulgaria.html">see more...</a></p>

    <p>Ecuador was the first place I move to outside of the United States. It is probably my favorite place that I have lived because of the people and the climate. We we able to meet so many people and travel to places like the Galapagos and the Amazon rain forest. I learned so much when I was in Ecuador and I would see more…</p>

    <p>I love Italy so much. I went sightseeing there more than any place I have been. My favorite place that I saw was the Rome Italy temple for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
